- BUG #1:  authUser()
  No matter if the code is truthy or false or if the i use the bad or good it seems to always pass. Here is something wrong
  looking at the Jobly assignment i see that this auth is nothing verifying nor is the sercery key being pasted in.
  after providing the bug fix 1 the tests are working
